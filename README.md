## Alex Clifford

Late 2019, after much research and completing several online courses, I decided to make a career change from Leisure into Software Development, my first step was to throw myself into an intense 3-month coding boot camp at Makers Academy. This taught me some excellent core skills, languages and practices. It also let me work solo on my tasks and collaboratively on group projects, culminating in a group 'final project' that would be the show-piece of my time at Makers pulling together everything I had learnt. It was an interesting experience going back to fulltime education, I feel that learning how to learn again and entering a non-traditional self-taught system took me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow.

I am a hard working individual who strives to deliver the highest calibre of work. Coming from a strong sporting background I work well in a team/ group environment as well as working autonomously. This allows me to develop my interpersonal skills accompanied by taking initiative and making decisions when necessary. I am a level headed thinker who thrives under pressure. My attention to detail is an attribute that I pride myself on and I'm always looking to improve myself in all aspects of my personal life and professional career.

## Skills

**Work well under pressure** - First aid plays a major part in my workplace experiences and having dealt with all manner of incidents I know in myself that I can think clearly, logically and act with purpose and direction under intense pressure. I have successfully performed CPR 3 times while working in the leisure industry- making decisions, delegating clear roles and galvanising a team to a single purpose.

**Team-player** - I have always been happy working in a team environment, offering my support to those who need it or in a leadership role depending on the situation. During my fulltime education at Makers Academy, it was always a priority to make sure my team were encouraged and motivated, I would often suggest daily stand-ups and retros with a different scrum master each day, this allowed everyone to have a voice and feel valued. On a more social level, group lunches or activities were an excellent way to bring people together.

**Attention to detail** - Good foundations come from being able to spot the imperfections or gaps and fix them. Having collaborated on several workplace policies/ auditing documents during my time in leisure, and coding projects at my time at makers, I aim to bring a high standard of forward-thinking. Something I learned from Makers Academy was best coding practice and principles and I aim to refer to them in the future to produce high-quality code. 

**Project orientated** - I enjoy having an end goal, something to aim for that my skills can be tested on. Something that can be worked on, delivered, and reviewed. We had many different coding projects at Makers Academy and each of them was engaging and educational tackling new challenges and technologies. Giving and receiving feedback after a project is always important as it allows an opportunity for self-reflection.

**Driven** - A firm believer that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. I always strive to do my best and push myself. I have been able to reach a high level of competition in my sport / esport career and I owe this to putting in the time and effort. As part of our final project at Makers Academy we took on new technologies in order to put our skills to the test, this challenged us to learn, adapt and overcome in a short space of time.

## Projects and Code

**Route Around** - A single page web app designed for urban runners, walkers and dog walkers. It allows a user to plot a circular route for the desired distance, using either a location (postcode) or current location (using geolocation services). This app was written in Node.js, React.js and Express. We used a Google API for the relevant map features.
