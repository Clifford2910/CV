## Alex Clifford

I am a hard working individual who strives to deliver the highest calibre of work. Coming from a strong sporting background I work well in a team/ group environment as well as working autonomously. This allows me to develop my interpersonal skills accompanied by taking initiative and making decisions when necessary. I am a level headed thinker who thrives under pressure. My attention to detail is an attribute that I pride myself on and im always looking to improve myself in all aspects of my personal life and professional career

## Skills

**Team-player** - Always been happy working in a team environment, offering my support to those who need it or in a leadership role depending on the situation.

**Adaptable** - Having worked with a wide variety of different people from different backgrounds and industries i have always been able to connect well and enjoy the opportunity of meeting new people and working on different tasks.

**Driven** - A firm believer that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. I always strive to do my best and push myself.

**Attention to detail** - Good foundations come from being able to spot the imperfections or gaps and fix them. Having collaborated on several workplace policies, I aim to bring a high standard of forward thinking.

**Enthusiastic** - I bring a good energy, a can-do attitude and throw myself into work. Regardless of how difficult or time consuming it is.

**Work well under pressure** - First aid plays a major part in my workplace experiences, and having dealt with all manor of incidents I know in myself that I am able to think clearly, logically and act with purpose and direction under intense pressure.

**Hands-on** - Always on hand to get stuck in with work or learning a new skill. Sometimes you’ve got to get in a mess to get out of a mess, but as long as you learn along the way, it’s an experience you can call upon.

**Project orientated** - I have always enjoyed having an end goal, something to aim for that my skills can be tested within. Something that can be worked on, delivered, and reviewed
