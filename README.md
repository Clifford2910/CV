## Alex Clifford

I am a hard working individual who strives to deliver the highest calibre of work. Coming from a strong sporting background I work well in a team/ group environment as well as working autonomously. This allows me to develop my interpersonal skills accompanied by taking initiative and making decisions when necessary. I am a level headed thinker who thrives under pressure. My attention to detail is an attribute that I pride myself on and im always looking to improve myself in all aspects of my personal life and professional career. Recently I have been attending tech meetups to gain a better understanding of the industry and upskill myself

## Skills

**Work well under pressure** - First aid plays a major part in my workplace experiences, and having dealt with all manor of incidents I know in myself that I am able to think clearly, logically and act with purpose and direction under intense pressure. I have successfully performed CPR 3 times while working in the leisure industry- making decisions, delegating clear roles and galvanising a team to a single purpose.

**Team-player** - Always been happy working in a team environment, offering my support to those who need it or in a leadership role depending on the situation. During my fulltime education at Makers Academy it was always a priority to make sure my team was having fun and were motivated, this also shows in how productive we were in our projects and how harmonious the enviroment was.

**Adaptable** - Having worked with a wide variety of different people from different backgrounds and industries i have always been able to connect well and enjoy the opportunity of meeting new people and working on different tasks. Being able to be responsive and flexible is something I strive for.

**Driven** - A firm believer that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. I always strive to do my best and push myself.

**Attention to detail** - Good foundations come from being able to spot the imperfections or gaps and fix them. Having collaborated on several workplace policies and coding projects, I aim to bring a high standard of forward thinking. Something I learned from Makers Academy was best coding practice and principles and i aim to refer to them in the future in order to produce high quality code  

**Enthusiastic** - I bring a good energy, a can-do attitude and throw myself into work. Regardless of how difficult or time consuming it is.

**Hands-on** - Always on hand to get stuck in with work or learning a new skill. Sometimes you’ve got to get in a mess to get out of a mess, but as long as you learn along the way, it’s an experience you can call upon. One of the things I learned while coding is that its always best to try, the more code you write the more you may get wrong, but the more breakthroughs you will have. 

**Project orientated** - I have always enjoyed having an end goal, something to aim for that my skills can be tested within. Something that can be worked on, delivered, and reviewed. We had many different coding projects at Makers Academy and each of them were fun and educational with regards to overcoming a new challenge or technology

## Projects and Code

**Route Around** - A single page web app designed for urban runners, walkers and dog walkers. It allows a user to plot a circular route for the desired distance, using either a location (postcode) or current location (using geolocation services). This app was written in Node.js, React.js and Express. We used a Google API for the relevent map features. This was made in 2 weeks as part of the Makers Academy final project. One of the challenges we faced during the final project was being able to communicate effectively while taking on a heavy work and learning load. We managed to counter this by holding daily stand-ups and retros. This gave us a platform to discuss any successes or blockers and let team members explain what they had been working on and give a technical overview.
