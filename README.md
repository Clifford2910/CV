## Alex Clifford

I am a hard working individual who strives to deliver the highest calibre of work. Coming from a strong sporting background I work well in a team/ group environment as well as working autonomously. This allows me to develop my interpersonal skills accompanied by taking initiative and making decisions when necessary. I am a level headed thinker who thrives under pressure. My attention to detail is an attribute that I pride myself on and im always looking to improve myself in all aspects of my personal life and professional career

## Skills

**Team-player** - Always been happy working in a team environment, offering my support to those who need it or in a leadership role depending on the situation.

**Adaptable** - Having worked with a wide variety of different people from different backgrounds and industries i have always been able to connect well and enjoy the opportunity of meeting new people and working on different tasks.

**Driven** - A firm believer that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. I always strive to do my best and push myself.

**Attention to detail** - Good foundations come from being able to spot the imperfections or gaps and fix them. Having collaborated on several workplace policies, I aim to bring a high standard of forward thinking.

**Enthusiastic** - I bring a good energy, a can-do attitude and throw myself into work. Regardless of how difficult or time consuming it is.

**Work well under pressure** - First aid plays a major part in my workplace experiences, and having dealt with all manor of incidents I know in myself that I am able to think clearly, logically and act with purpose and direction under intense pressure.

**Hands-on** - Always on hand to get stuck in with work or learning a new skill. Sometimes you’ve got to get in a mess to get out of a mess, but as long as you learn along the way, it’s an experience you can call upon.

**Project orientated** - I have always enjoyed having an end goal, something to aim for that my skills can be tested within. Something that can be worked on, delivered, and reviewed

## Projects and Code

**Route Around** - A single page web app designed for urban runners, walkers and dog walkers. Without any prior knowledge of an area it allows a user to plot an interesting circular route for the desired distance, using either a location (postcode) or current location (using geolocation services), that doesn't double back on itself and starts and finishes in the same place for efficiency. We couldnt find anything like this on the market and anything we saw that was similar we found were either poorly done or locked behind high pay walls. This app was written in Node.js, React.js and Express. We used a Google API for the relevent map features such as postcode conversion and rendering the map. This was made in 2 week as part of the Makers Academy final project. We decided as part of our final project to use some technologies that were new to us and this tested our ability to learn and adapt in a short space of time.
